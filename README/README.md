# PyATM Software

## Overview
The PyATM Application is a simple GUI-based program that simulates an ATM system. Users can authenticate with a PIN, perform transactions such as withdrawing and depositing money, and check their account balance. This project is built using Python and `tkinter` for the graphical user interface.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Securely log in using a 4-digit PIN.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Withdraw money from your account.
- **Deposit Funds**: Deposit money into your account.
- **Check Balance**: View your current account balance.
- **Clear and Cancel**: Clear input fields or cancel ongoing transactions.
- **Instructions**: Access detailed instructions for using the application.

### Interacting with the software
You can refer to INSTRUCTIONS.md for this

## Configuration

### Data File
The user data and account information are stored in `atm_data.json`. It is located in data/ from the root directory of PyATM. Ensure it follows following format:
```json
{
    "users": {
        "1234": {
            "name": "ABC",
            "balance": 5000.0
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Software Does Not Start**: Verify Python installations and ensure required libraries are installed.
- **PIN Authentication Issues**: Confirm that the PIN you are using exists in `atm_data.json`.
- **Transaction Errors**: Ensure the amounts entered are valid and you have sufficient balance for withdrawals.
